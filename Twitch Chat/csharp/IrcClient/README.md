# Twitch Irc Client

## Current functions:

### Ping Pong
Answers "Mammoth!" when I ask "sid?" in chat
To see if bot is online

### New chatter recognition
Says hi to new chatters, and triggers a sound alert

### Hello to chatters
Known chatters get a sound alert and a hello when saying hi in channel 

### Custom sounds
Some selected chatters can have their own sound alert. Very manual implementation.
